# gemmahat
Gemma M0 hat with 6 leds and touch controls

hat project that uses Adafruit Gemma M0 wearable board to create a hat with leds that cycle through colors, touch sensors can be used to change the color scheme and rate of change

this is code that is franensteined together before I learned python, so copy paste from other things and kludged together, probably bad code

But it works.
